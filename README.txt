Musket:

Holding rightmouse while unloaded will load a bullet from the inventory, similarly to the crossbow.
Holding rightmouse when loaded aims the musket, and releasing fires the bullet. Aim time determines the accuracy.
Reloading takes 2 seconds, and aiming for 3 seconds is enough for perfectly accurate shots by default.
Firing a musket produces a visible cloud of smoke and the shot can be heard from far away, giving away the user's position.

Ammo:

Standard Cartridge: Deals 16 damage and ignores 10% of the target's armor efficacy.
Hellfire Cartridge: Deals 25% more damage than standard cartridges and decreases the target's armor by 25% for 30 seconds. Found in bastion chests or by trading with piglins.
Enchanted Cartridge: Has 25% higher velocity than standard cartridges and boosts musket enchantment effects. Crafted with an enchanted book and an equal number of gold nuggets and cartridges in a crafting table. Also sold by weaponsmith villagers.

All cartridges can be fired from dispensers.
Cartridges are deflected by breezes and ricochet off of iron golems, dealing only 25% of the damage.

Enchantments:

Firepower (I-V): Increases armor piercing of fired bullets by 10% per level.
Longshot (I-II): Amplifies damage against distant targets. (15-60% bonus at 16-48 blocks, 25-100% at level 2).
Repeating: Allows the musket to fire twice per reload. This amount is increased when reloading after a kill.

Gunslingers:

Spawns near outposts and will appear as part of raid waves.
Being expert shooters, they have an attack range of 24 and do not cause friendly fire damage.
They use a sawn-off to defend themselves at close range and retreat when approached.

Configuration:

Reload and aim time are configurable between 20-80 ticks.
Base cartridge damage is configurable between 12-24 damage, and the damage multiplier of Gunslingers are configurable.

Compatibility:
(Neoforge/Forge only) If Consecration is installed, enchanted cartridges can remove undead protection.
If Enchantment descriptions (or equivalent mod) is installed, the details of each enchantment will be displayed in-game.
If Useful Spyglass is installed, Muskets can be used with the Precision enchantment for increased damage and zoom while aiming.
