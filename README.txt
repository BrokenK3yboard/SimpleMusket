Musket:

Holding rightmouse while unloaded will load a bullet from the inventory, similarly to the crossbow.
Holding rightmouse when loaded aims the musket, and releasing fires the bullet. The aim time will determine the accuracy of the shot.
Pillagers are capable of wielding muskets of their own and will use them to attack the player from long range.

Ammo:

Iron: Deals 16 damage and ignores 50% of the target's armor.
Copper: Fires a wide spread of 5 pellets, each dealing 4 damage.
Gold: Deals 9 damage and increases up to 24 if fired from an enchanted musket. Damage bonus affected by the number and rarity of enchantments.
Netherite: Deals 20 damage and ignores 100% of the target's armor, but wears out the musket 3x faster. Found in bastion chests or by trading with piglins.

Enchantments:

Firepower (I-V): Increases armor piercing of fired bullets by 10% per level. Incompatible with Longshot.
Deadeye (I-III): Decreases aiming and reload time by 10% per level. Also tightens the spread of copper buckshot.
Longshot (I-II): Bullet damage increases the further away the target is, up to a maximum of 25% per level. Incompatible with Firepower.
Repeating: Allows the musket to fire twice per reload.

Compatibility:
If consecration is installed, golden bullets will instead deal extra damage to undead mobs in addition to removing their protection.
If Enchantment descriptions is installed, the details of each enchantment will be displayed in-game.
