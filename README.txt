Musket:

Holding rightmouse while unloaded will load a bullet from the inventory, similarly to the crossbow.
Holding rightmouse when loaded aims the musket, and releasing fires the bullet. Aim time determines the accuracy.
Reloading takes 2 seconds, and aiming for 3 seconds is enough for perfectly accurate shots by default.
Firing a musket produces a visible cloud of smoke and the shot can be heard from far away, giving away the user's position.

Ammo:

Standard Cartridge: Deals 16 damage and lowers the target's armor efficacy by 10%.
Hex Cartridge: Halves the target's defensive enchantment efficacy and increases an attacker's damage and armor piercing enchantments by two levels. Sold by weaponsmith villagers.
Hellfire Cartridge: Deals 20 damage and decreases the target's armor by 25% for 30 seconds. Found in bastion chests or by trading with piglins.

In 1.21 cartridges can be fired from dispensers, ricochet off of iron golems dealing only 25% of the damage, and are deflected by breezes.

Enchantments:

Firepower (I-V): Increases armor piercing of fired bullets by 10% per level.
Deadeye (I-III): Decrease aim time by 25/38/50% and move speed penalty while aiming by 50/75/100%.
Longshot (I-II): Amplifies damage against distant targets. (15-60% bonus at 16-48 blocks, 25-100% at level 2).
Repeating: Allows the musket to fire twice per reload.

Gunslinger/Musketeer Illagers:

Depending on the difficulty, 1-3 pillagers armed with muskets will spawn during raid waves.
Being expert shooters, they have an attack range of 24 and do not cause friendly fire damage.
As of 1.6.0, they have been reworked into Gunslingers. They use a sawn-off to defend themselves at close range and retreat when approached.

Configuration:

The base reload and aim times of the musket are configurable between 40-80 in-game ticks.
The damage of gunslingers can be reduced by 25%.

Compatibility:
(Neoforge/Forge only) If Consecration is installed, enchanted/hex cartridges remove undead protection.
If Enchantment descriptions (or equivalent mod) is installed, the details of each enchantment will be displayed in-game.
