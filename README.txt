Musket:

Holding rightmouse while unloaded will load a bullet from the inventory, similarly to the crossbow.
Holding rightmouse when loaded aims the musket, and releasing fires the bullet. The aim time will determine the accuracy of the shot.
Pillagers are capable of wielding muskets of their own and will use them to attack the player from long range.

Ammo:

Standard Cartridge: Deals 16 damage and ignores 50% of the target armor.
Hellfire Cartridge: Same as the standard cartridge, but applies a 25% armor decrease for 15 seconds.

Enchantments:

Firepower (I-V): Increases armor piercing of bullets by 10% per level. Incompatible with Longshot and Blast.
Deadeye (I-III): Decrease aim time by 25/38/50% and move speed penalty by 50/75/100%.
Longshot (I-II): Damage is amplified against targets further than 16 blocks away. (15-40% bonus at 16-48 blocks, 25-100% at level 2)
Blast (I-II): Increase main shot damage to 125% within 8 blocks and fires 4/8 additional pellets with 25% damage and increased dispersion. Damage does not stack.
Repeating: Allows the musket to fire twice per reload.

Compatibility:
If consecration is installed, enchanted bullets can be crafted with gold which deal 8 damage, which doubles against undead enemies and removes their protection.
If Enchantment descriptions (or equivalent mod) is installed, the details of each enchantment will be displayed in-game.
